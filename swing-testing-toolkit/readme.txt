DESCRIPTION
-----------
Swing Testing Toolkit is a Java-Swing GUI testing framework. 
It uses a semi-automatic test case generation approach aimed at reducing 
testing instructions to the bare minimum while ensuring that they are as 
relevant as possible.
It is not a universal GUI testing framework. It focuses on a single 
library (Swing) to guarantee its level of quality.
